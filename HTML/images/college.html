<p>College culture refers to the unique environment, values, traditions, and social norms that develop within a college community. It shapes how students interact, learn, and engage both inside and outside the classroom. This culture can include everything from academic expectations and dress codes to campus events, student organizations, and informal social rules. While some colleges are known for their focus on academics or sports, others may be recognized for activism, creativity, or community service. College culture plays a key role in student identity and development, influencing friendships, career goals, and personal growth.</p>
