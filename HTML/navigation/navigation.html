             <h1>The Story Of KGF</h1>
             <section>
                <p> Rocky was born in poverty. His mother raised him with love but struggled every day. 
                    Before dying, she made him promise one thing — to become the most powerful man in the world.
                     That one sentence becomes his life’s mission.He goes to Bombay as a young boy and grows up in the 
                     criminal underworld. He fights, survives, and slowly earns a name. People start fearing him.
                      But inside, he’s not satisfied. His eyes are on something bigger — KGF.
                      KGF is a secret gold mine ruled by a brutal empire. The workers there live like slaves.
                       No one dares to speak up. It’s a hell covered in gold dust.Rocky enters KGF like a storm. 
                       He studies the system, uses brains and brawn, and begins to break their control. 
                       He fights powerful enemies, wins hearts, and turns fear into respect.
                       Every move he makes is for his mother’s dream. He doesn't want just money or fame — he wants total power.
                       In a land where death is normal and hope is rare, Rocky rises like a king. 
                       From the streets of Bombay to the throne of KGF, his journey becomes a legend.</p>
