                    <h1>About My Self</h1>
                    <p>My name is Srinath. I’m from Hosur, and I’m currently staying in Jafferkhanpetns for some study reasons. 
                        I have completed my BCA degree from <b> MGR Arts and Science College, Hosur.</b>
                         I’m very interested in the field of<b> software development</b>. I joined SLA for training To improve my technical skills .
                          I also have 3 years of experience in photography, where I worked with some private limited companies. 
                          Through this,<i> I developed good teamwork, and time management skills.</i>
                           I am a quick learner and enjoy working with others and solving problems.
                            I’m excited about this opportunity <i>to grow, learn more, and move forward in my software career.</i> 
                        Thank you for giving me this chance to introduce myself.</p>
